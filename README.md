S-Cubed--Intermediate
=====================

Logic, Strings, and Arrays

This program just runs a handful of functions in the main class that have to do with logic, strings, and arrays. The main function will run each method five times, then ask the user for input if they would like to run some of their own examples with their own input in the console. Explanations for each method are given in the comments abover each function header.

To run this program in the (Windows) command prompt, a JAR file is provided in /Intermediate/dist. To run the file, and assuming you have Java installed, you need to type in "java -jar Intermediate.java".
